Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).



Example 1:
```text
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```
Example 2:
```text
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```
Example 3:
```text
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```


Constraints:

```text
-100.0 < x < 100.0
-231 <= n <= 231-1
n is an integer.
Either x is not zero or n > 0.
-104 <= xn <= 104
```
